# 📄 One-Pager Pitch — ProofFeed

## 🔴 Problem

Misinformation spreads faster than truth in today’s digital landscape.  
Centralized social platforms lack transparency, accountability, and verifiable credibility signals. Fact-checking is often slow, opaque, and controlled by a small group of authorities, while users have no way to verify **how** a verdict was reached.

This results in:
- Loss of public trust  
- Viral fake news with real-world consequences  
- No incentives for communities to participate in truth verification

## 🟢 Solution — ProofFeed

**ProofFeed** is a **decentralized news validation platform** that combines:

- **AI-based analysis** for initial credibility assessment  
- **Community voting** for collective intelligence  
- **Blockchain transparency** for immutable records  
- **ZK identity verification** for privacy-preserving trust  

### How it works:
1. Users upload news or claims  
2. AI generates an initial credibility score  
3. The community votes (Real / Fake / Uncertain)  
4. A final credibility score is derived from AI + community consensus  
5. All votes and verdicts are recorded on-chain  

ProofFeed creates a **public, tamper-proof credibility layer** for news.
